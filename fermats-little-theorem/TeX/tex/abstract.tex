Fermat's little theorem states that for any prime integer and non-multiple integer of the prime, the integer raised to the power of the prime - 1 in the prime modulo has a remainder of 1. Euler's theorem is a generalisation that takes two integers which are relatively prime, and considers the totient of the modulo as the exponent. This consequently led to a functioning design of the RSA cryptography algorithm. In this paper, both theorems and the correctness of the algorithm will be proved in an elegant manner.
