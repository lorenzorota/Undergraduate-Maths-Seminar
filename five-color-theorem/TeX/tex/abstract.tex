The four colour theorem, inspired by a colour minimisation problem in cartography, states that the vertices of a planar graph can take on at least 4 colours, such that no vertices with the same colour are adjacent to each other. Due to the highly exhaustive nature of the proof, a related yet easier theorem will be proved. This paper will focus on the necessary background and the proof of the five colour theorem
